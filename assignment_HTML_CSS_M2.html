					He graduated from the Belgrade high school, and attended the natural science and mathematics section
					of the University of Belgrade. In 1879 he traveled to Munich where he studied music in the class of

				<h2>Works</h2>
				<p>
					His life was highly influenced by church and folk songs, and he used these two types of music as
					inspiration for his work. His most famous pieces are the fifteen <em>Rukoveti</em> (Potpourri;
					literally: "handfuls" or "bunches") - a collection of songs and music (orchestral suites) based on
					motives of Serbian folk music from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia Proper, Montenegro, Kosovo and
					Metohija, Macedonia and Bulgaria. His other prominent folk-based works include
					<em>Primorski napjevi</em> (Coastland tunes), and <em>Kozar</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					A significant number of his works were made for church services, such as the
					<em>Božanstvena Liturgija Svetog Jovana Zlatoustog</em> (The Divine Liturgy of St. Chrysostom), from
					which the <em>Heruvimska pesma</em> (Cherubic hymn) is most famous. Another two famous religious
					pieces are <em>Tebe Boga hvalim</em> (Te Deum) and <em>Veličanije Sv. Savi</em> (Megalynarion to St.
					Sava).
